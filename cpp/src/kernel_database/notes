File 1 would have:

#include "grid_stride.h"

template __global__ void grid_stride<double, double, double>(double*, double*,
                                                             double*, size_t);



File 2 would have:

template<typename T, typename S, typename R> __global__ void grid_stride(double*, double*, double*, size_t);
register_linear_access_kernel<grid_stride<double*, double*, double*>>();

We could also pass the file name or c string to `register_kernel`




Notes:

1. We need a way to describe arguments as either pointers or constant values
2. We need way to register ( grid_stride<double*, double*> and grid_stride<double,double*> )
3. We need `grid_stride.h` to handle
